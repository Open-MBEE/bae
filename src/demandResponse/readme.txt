This demandResponse folder/package contains hand-built classes to illustrate 
what the model might look like in Java.  The 
gov.nasa.jpl.ae.tests/TestExecute.java can be run as a Java application to 
simulate three of the classes in this folder.  More interesting simulations
may be found by generating the Java model from XML using other tests in
gov.nasa.jpl.ae.tests.
